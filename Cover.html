        <h3>Experience Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I've been working with technology since 2018.  I've worked professionally with enterprise surveilance systems, 
            autopilot navigation systems for experimental aircraft, industrial network and data systems, and many more 
            diverse technologies.  In my personal life, I've worked hard to build a robust and resilliant homelab and I've 
            been learning to work with various programming languages, starting with C++ and Python, and more recently, 
            Visual Basic and Java. 
        </p>
        <h3>My Perceived Calling</h3>
        <p>
            I am following my calling now by learning and growing so I can help people leverage information technology to 
            expand and improve their lives.  Working in IT has been my passion for years.  The people I meet and the work 
            I get to do is highly fulfilling and is very clearly my calling.
